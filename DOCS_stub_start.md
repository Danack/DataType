# DataType

DataType is a library that makes working with named types of data easier. It features:

* Easy to work with those types.
* Clear error messages for users.
* Generating OpenAPI/Swagger specification for those types, so that frontend code can use the exact same specification.


## Example usage

Imagine we have a "GreetingController" as an API end-point. This end-point takes two parameters, a 'name' and an 'excitement' level, for how excited you want the greeting to be.


```php
<!-- Example_basic_usage -->
```

The above example would throw a ValidationException if there were any validation problems. If you prefer to have errors just returned, you can use the `CreateOrErrorFromRequest` trait:

Example_basic_usage_no_exception
```php
<!-- Example_basic_usage_no_exception -->
```

Now errors will be returned rather than an exception being thrown.

## Using without annotations

Although annotations work nicely with this library, some people have strong feelings against using them.

It is possible to use this library without them, it just requires a bit more wiring up:  

```php
<!-- Example_without_annotations -->
```
